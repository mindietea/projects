## OpenGL Nature Project

An interactive nature experience programmed using OpenGL and GLSL. The terrain is procedurally generated with Perlin noise. The user can move around the scene and also control the strength and direction of the wind that animates the grass. The water is shaded realistically with transparency and reflection of the skybox.

This project was a final project for Professor Vouga's Graphics Honors class at UT Austin, where we were given the opportunity to propose our own project and implement it.

I worked on the wind animations, realistic water shading, and skyboxes.

Made with C++ and GLSL.
