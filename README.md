A list of some of my significant projects.

## OpenGL Nature Project

An interactive nature experience programmed using OpenGL and GLSL. The terrain is procedurally generated with Perlin noise. The user can move around the scene and also control the strength and direction of the wind that animates the grass. The water is shaded realistically with transparency and reflection of the skybox.

This project was a final project for Professor Vouga's Graphics Honors class at UT Austin, where we were given the opportunity to propose our own project and implement it.

I worked on the wind animations, realistic water shading, and skyboxes.

Made with C++ and GLSL.

## CHIP-8 Emulator & Game

An emulator for the CHIP-8 architecture made for writing and running simple games. It runs existing CHIP-8 games I was able to find online. I was also able to design and write a game using the CHIP-8 architecture that then runs on the emulator! There are options to set the pixel scaling and clock speed, since none is defined by the architecture.

Created for my Computer Architecture Honors final project at UT Austin, where we proposed and implemented a project of our choice.

(If you have Linux, you can try and follow the instructions in part 5 here to run the emulator and game: https://github.com/mindietea/braveone/blob/master/part2.txt#L10)

## Face Feud

Created for HackTX 2018.

This was a solo side project for the hackathon to quickly implement a fun idea I had for a game.
