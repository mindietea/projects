A list of some of my significant projects

## OpenGL Nature Project
An interactive nature experience programmed using OpenGL and GLSL. The terrain is procedurally generated with Perlin noise. The user can move around the scene and also control the strength and direction of the wind that animates the grass. The water is shaded realistically with transparency and reflection of the skybox.
This project was a final project for Vouga's Graphics Honors class at UT Austin, where we were given the opportunity to propose our own project and implement it.
